# Arduino Rotary Encoder + Servo Control

Control a servo motor (0–180°) using a rotary encoder.

Rotate clockwise  → Servo angle increases  
Rotate counterclockwise → Servo angle decreases

## 📜 How It Works

The rotary encoder detects rotation direction and updates the servo angle.  
The angle is limited between 0° and 180°.
